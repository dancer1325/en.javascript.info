<body>
<!-- Module script -->
<script type="module">
    alert("Module script " +  (typeof button)); // object
    // Module scripts are deferred -> the script runs after the whole page is loaded -> button is already defined
</script>

Compare to regular script below:

<!-- Regular script -->
<script>
    alert("Regular script defined before " + (typeof button)); // undefined
    // Regular scripts run immediately and since it's before define the button -> button not defined yet
</script>

<button id="button">Button</button>

<!-- Regular script -->
<script>
    alert("Regular script defined after " + (typeof button)); // undefined
    // Regular scripts run immediately, but since it's after defining the button -> button already defined yet
</script>

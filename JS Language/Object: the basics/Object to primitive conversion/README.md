# [Object to primitive conversion](https://javascript.info/object-toprimitive)

## How to run locally?
* Open 'index.html' in your browser

## Content
* Apply conversions to objects
* hints
  * `[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) {...}`
    * customize object conversion to primitives based on hint

## Notes
* Check previously 'JS language/JS Fundamentals/Type conversions'
* `console.log` works differently respect to hints than `alert`, to identify which to pick
  * normal or expected behavior should come with `alert`
